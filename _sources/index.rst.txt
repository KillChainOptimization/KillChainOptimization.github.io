Welcome to the Kill-Chain Optimization website!
===============================================

The Kill-Chain Optimization project is part of the George Mason University (GMU) Master's Capstone Project for the Systems Engineering/
Operations Research graduate programs (SYST/OR 699) for the Spring 2023 semester. This project was coordinated with the Office of the
Secretary of Defense's Cost Analysis Program (OSD/CAPE). The project is named after an effort by our sponsor's team to solve Kill-Chains
using a Mixed Integer Program, but the amount of time that it took to solve a problem was unreasonably long; so our team was asked to 
use a Constraint Programming approach to see if you would run faster. Below is a diagram of how a Kill-Chain works. A Kill-Chain is 
composed of a platform that goes through a series of steps before it decides to prosecute a target. This can be modeled as a flexible 
job shop problem - a target can be targeted, tracked, and killed by a series of different platforms and the goal of our Constraint 
Programming solution is to find the minimize makespan (time to kill targets) while being able to find an optimal solution more quickly
than the Mixed Integer Programming model that is currently in place.
